# Incident Analyst Training 19-2 Playbook

## What is it?

## How to use

This was originally a Word document that I used as a quick reference during my assessments. I will try and keep the table of contents as descriptive as possible so it should be easy to find whatever you're looking for. 

Every thing will also be kept on a single page so you'll be able to CTRL+f.
