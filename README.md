# Incident Analyst Training 19-2 Playbook

## What is it?

The Incident Analyst Training (IAT) is a string of commercial and in house cyber flavoured training courses. The aim is to complete the entire training over five months. There are multiple assessments along the way and when I went through it I also completed GCFA and GNFA certifications. 

The target audience for this writeup is future students of this course.

## How to use

This was originally a Word document that I used as a quick reference during my assessments. I will try and keep the table of contents as descriptive as possible so it should be easy to find whatever you're looking for. 

Every thing will also be kept on a single page so you'll be able to CTRL+f.
